    <h2 class="interview-right">Neural networks are powerful tools used for pattern recognition and classification. One common type, the multilayer perceptron, can be trained to recognize handwritten digits by learning from examples. It belongs to a broader class of machine learning models that approximate complex functions through layers of interconnected nodes.

    </h2>
    <h2 class="interview-left">The network processes input as a grid of pixel values and predicts the most likely digit. During training, the model adjusts internal weights to reduce prediction errors. The more examples it sees, the better it becomes at recognizing digits with high accuracy.
